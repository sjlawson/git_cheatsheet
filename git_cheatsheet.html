                <h2>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Git</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="body">
                <p>This document assumes you know the basic git commands: status, commit, clone, branch, checkout, merge, push, pull, add, rm, log, fetch, and tag.  Additionally, I am assuming you have a basic understanding of git internals, such as what HEAD means, what a branch is, and how to write useful commit messages.  If you don't, please don't hesitate to ask your neighbor.  I recommend reading Scott Chacon's excellent book "<a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Pro Git</a>".</p>

                <p>I know that most people use git clients instead of the command line.  I will describe how to use the command line, and it will be up to you to translate this to your specific client.</p>

                <p>One important point: as with any good program, there are several ways to accomplish the exact same thing.  Git is well known for having numerous shortcut methods, as well.  I am presenting what works for me.  I'm certain that in many cases, there are simpler and easier ways of accomplishing the exact same task.  This document is itself in a git repository: improve it and share your changes.</p>

                <h2>Core Guidelines</h2>
                <ol class="core-guidelines">
                    <li>Never work on a shared branch.</li>
                    <li>Only merge a branch into its parent branch.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Create A New Branch</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Checkout the parent branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout &lt;parent-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pull in the latest and greatest code from your coworkers.
                        <div class="code">
                            git pull origin &lt;parent-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create your new branch from the parent branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout -b &lt;child-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Merge A Branch</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Check that the branch to merge is in a stable, committed state.
                        <div class="code">
                            git status
                        </div>
                        You should get something like this:
                        <div class="code">
                            # On branch master<br />
                            nothing to commit (working directory clean)
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check out the parent branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout &lt;parent-branch-name&gt;<br />
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pull in the latest and greatest code from your coworkers.
                        <div class="code">
                            git pull origin &lt;parent-branch-name&gt;<br />
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Merge the child branch.  (Note: I highly recommend using the "no-fast-forward" (--no-ff) flag.  This might save you a huge headache if you need to back out your merge.)
                        <div class="code">
                            git merge --no-ff &lt;child-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If there are any merge conflicts, you would get a message like this:
                        <div class="code">
                            CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html<br />
                            Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
                        </div>
                        Git is giving you instructions.  Follow them.  Fix the conflict (now), and then commit the result.  Once you commit the result, your merge is complete.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Share your changes with the group.<br />
                        If you merged into a shared branch, you must share with the group.  If you merged into a private branch and you do not want to share, do not do this step.
                        <div class="code">
                            git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Deleting A Branch</h3>
                You must never delete the "staging" and "master" branches.  Project branches should only be deleted after the project is done.  Personal branches can be deleted once they are merged.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Delete the branch
                        <div class="code">
                            git branch -d &lt;branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Recommended Daily Workflow</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        At the start of the day, get the lastest and greatest code from your coworkers. Start work on your personal branch.<br />
                        Note: Since you will be managing a large number of branches in your repository, having a standard branch naming scheme is very handy.  I name my personal branches as the project name prefixed with my initials.  (Ex: ktw-mhc_poslog)  Whatever you do is up to you, just make it work for you.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout &lt;project-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git pull origin &lt;project-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git checkout -b &lt;personal-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the end of the day, share your latest and greatest code with the rest of the team.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout &lt;project-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git pull origin &lt;project-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git merge --no-ff &lt;personal-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git push origin &lt;project-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delete your personal branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git branch -d &lt;personal-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go home and have a beer.  \o/
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Patching (Rarely done)</h3>
                <p>Reference: <a href="http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/">http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/</a></p>
                <p>Occasionally, you will need to merge your branch to a non-parent branch.  This is done with patches.  In this example we will fix a bug (issue #45) on master.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Checkout master.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout master<br />
                            git pull origin master
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a child branch for our bugfix.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout -b issue45
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fix the bug and commit all your changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a patch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git format-patch master --stdout > issue45.patch
                        </div>
                        This will squash the entire branch (issue45) into one patch, and write the patch file to your drive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Merge your changes back into master.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout master<br />
                            git pull origin master<br />
                            git merge --no-ff issue45<br />
                            git push origin master
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Patch the non-parent branches.  Ex: staging<br />
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The first step is to check that the patch applies to the non-parent branch.
                                <div class="code">
                                    git checkout staging<br />
                                    git apply --check issue45.patch
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you get no errors, then the patch applied successfully.  Now we apply the patch.
                                <div class="code">
                                    git apply issue45.patch<br />
                                    git commit -am 'Fixing issue #45.'<br />
                                    git push origin staging
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Email the patch file to your coworkers so they can apply the patch to their personal branches, if necessary.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delete the issue branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git branch -d issue45
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
