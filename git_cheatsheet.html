                <h2>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Git</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="body">
                <p>This document assumes you know the basic git commands: status, commit, clone, branch, checkout, merge, push, pull, add, rm, log, fetch, and tag.  Additionally, I am assuming you have a basic understanding of git internals, such as what HEAD means, what a branch is, and how to write useful commit messages.  If you don't, please don't hesitate to ask your neighbor.  I recommend reading Scott Chacon's excellent book "<a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Pro Git</a>".</p>

                <p>I know that most people use git clients instead of the command line.  I will describe how to use the command line, and it will be up to you to translate this to your specific client.</p>

                <p>One important point: as with any good program, there are several ways to accomplish the exact same thing.  Git is well known for having numerous shortcut methods, as well.  I am presenting what works for me.  I'm certain that in many cases, there are simpler and easier ways of accomplishing the exact same task.  This document is itself in a git repository: improve it and share your changes.</p>

                <h2>Core Guidelines</h2>
                <ol class="core-guidelines">
                    <li>Never work on a shared branch.</li>
                    <li>Only merge a branch into its parent branch.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Create A New Branch</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Checkout the parent branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout &lt;parent-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pull in the latest and greatest code from your coworkers.
                        <div class="code">
                            git pull origin &lt;parent-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create your new branch from the parent branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout -b &lt;child-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Merge A Branch</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Check that the branch to merge is in a stable, committed state.
                        <div class="code">
                            git status
                        </div>
                        You should get something like this:
                        <div class="code">
                            # On branch master<br />
                            nothing to commit (working directory clean)
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check out the parent branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout &lt;parent-branch-name&gt;<br />
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pull in the latest and greatest code from your coworkers.
                        <div class="code">
                            git pull origin &lt;parent-branch-name&gt;<br />
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Merge the child branch.  (Note: I highly recommend using the "no-fast-forward" (--no-ff) flag.  This might save you a huge headache if you need to back out your merge.)
                        <div class="code">
                            git merge --no-ff &lt;child-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If there are any merge conflicts, you would get a message like this:
                        <div class="code">
                            CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html<br />
                            Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
                        </div>
                        Git is giving you instructions.  Follow them.  Fix the conflict (now), and then commit the result.  Once you commit the result, your merge is complete.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Share your changes with the group.<br />
                        If you merged into a shared branch, you must share with the group.  If you merged into a private branch and you do not want to share, do not do this step.
                        <div class="code">
                            git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Deleting A Branch</h3>
                You must never delete the "staging" and "master" branches.  Project branches should only be deleted after the project is done.  Personal branches can be deleted once they are merged.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Delete the branch
                        <div class="code">
                            git branch -d &lt;branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Recommended Daily Workflow</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        At the start of the day, get the lastest and greatest code from your coworkers. Start work on your personal branch.<br />
                        Note: Since you will be managing a large number of branches in your repository, having a standard branch naming scheme is very handy.  I name my personal branches as the project name prefixed with my initials.  (Ex: ktw-mhc_poslog)  Whatever you do is up to you, just make it work for you.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout &lt;project-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git pull origin &lt;project-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git checkout -b &lt;personal-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the end of the day, share your latest and greatest code with the rest of the team.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout &lt;project-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git pull origin &lt;project-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git merge --no-ff &lt;personal-branch-name&gt;<br />
                            git push origin &lt;project-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delete your personal branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git branch -d &lt;personal-branch-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go home and have a beer.  \o/
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Patching (Rarely done)</h3>
                <p>Reference: <a href="http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/">http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/</a></p>
                <p>Occasionally, you will need to merge your branch to a non-parent branch.  This is done with patches.  In this example we will fix a bug (issue #45) on master.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Checkout master.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout master<br />
                            git pull origin master
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a child branch for our bugfix.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout -b issue45
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fix the bug and commit all your changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a patch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git format-patch master --stdout > issue45.patch
                        </div>
                        This will squash the entire branch (issue45) into one patch, and write the patch file to your drive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Merge your changes back into master.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout master<br />
                            git pull origin master<br />
                            git merge --no-ff issue45<br />
                            git push origin master
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Patch the non-parent branches.  Ex: staging<br />
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The first step is to check that the patch applies to the non-parent branch.
                                <div class="code">
                                    git checkout staging<br />
                                    git apply --check issue45.patch
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you get no errors, then the patch applied successfully.  Now we apply the patch.
                                <div class="code">
                                    git apply issue45.patch<br />
                                    git commit -am 'Fixing issue #45.'<br />
                                    git push origin staging
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Email the patch file to your coworkers so they can apply the patch to their personal branches, if necessary.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delete the issue branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git branch -d issue45
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Pushing code to master</h3>
                <p>The staging and master branch should be mostly in sync.  The only differences should be the changes in staging waiting to be moved into the master branch.  Currently, our staging and master branches are out of sync.  Therefore, we use this little technique to push code into the master branch.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Note: When we get a real deployment system, this will no longer be used.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Merge all your code into the staging branch using the above techniques.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Checkout the master branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout master
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pull the latest from the master branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git pull origin master
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Navigate to the modules directory below the module you wish to merge.
                        <div class="code">
                            cd &lt;some-path&gt;/modules
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Checkout the module from the staging branch.
                        <div class="code">
                            git checkout staging &lt;module-name&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changes have not been pulled into the master branch.  You must commit them.  (You may need to add the files first.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Push your changes.
                        <div class="code">
                            git push origin master
